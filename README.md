# RateMyPritch

## What are we about?
Our project is a rating app for the Pritchard Dining Hall. We noticed that with the variety of food, it can often times be confusing as to what to pick and which foods fit dietary restrictions. Our rating app aims to ease those concerns, with a few clicks of a button, you can rate Pritchard items to see which ones are the right fit for you!

## How to run the code?
Our code's final product will be an APK file that can run on android devices. Currently, we are using Android Studio's mobile device emulator to emulate a real phone as we make adjustments to the app.

## Class Organization
Our classes are organized by each unique page our users will encounter throughout their use of our app. 
Our classes are as follows:
- AssignReview (Assign reviews page)
- CurrentReviews (List of Current Reviews for a Particular Item)
- MainView (The apps homescreen which includes different departments, meal of the day, time and home and settings)
- LandingPage (Sign-up page with option to continue without signing up)
- My_Reviews (List of users current reviews as well as user control buttons)
- Sign_Up_Page (Sign up page)
